    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Kacchi Mutton Biryani is a delicious rice dish where tender goat or lamb meat pieces are marinated with lots of fried onions, whole spices, fresh herbs and yoghurt. This marinated meat sits on the bottom of the pot topped with half-cooked rice which is drizzled with saffron-infused water and more fried onions and fresh mint leaves. Sealed and slow-cooked in an oven or on stove-top to a delicious aromatic finger-licking biryani that you may serve with some kachumber, salad, and if you are like us, more pappadoms!</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the fried onions by deep-frying in hot oil. Separate the strands of the sliced onions with your hands. Keep the flame low to medium all time, stir in between to fry evenly and fry till you see the onions changing shades for about 4 mins. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon on time before they get burnt. The onions will continue to cook even when you take them out, so remove them when you see the golden light brown shade. Spread the fried onions on a paper towel to drain the excess oil (It will become crispy as it cools). Let it cool completely before storing it in an airtight box and in the freezer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure you have washed and drained and pat dried the meat completely to avoid excess moisture. Add the mutton and the rest of the marinade items and mix thoroughly with your hand preferably. Cover and refrigerate overnight or at least 6 hours. Take it out 30 minutes before you start the rice prep.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soak a pinch of saffron in 2 tablespoons of hot water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil a lot of water in a deep large pot with more salt than usual, green chillies, cardamoms and cloves. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the drained rice and bring to boil on high flame. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce to medium flame and boil for just about 90 seconds to 2 minutes (30% to 50% cooked) and switch off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the rice in a colander immediately. Reserve Â¼ cup of water for later. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If making the mutton biryani in an oven, then the temperature to preheat the oven can be 165c to 170c with a rack on level 2. Spread the marinated mutton in a single layer on the bottom of the biryani pot (oven friendly).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the drained rice evenly and pour the reserved water all around (in case you feel the rice is almost cooked because you forgot to drain on time, then skip adding the reserved water)
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the fried onions, mint leaves and saffron water (you may squeeze some lemon juice or rose water and a few dollops of ghee for extra flavour)
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the brewed saffron water all over the rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and seal the pot with foil and then with the lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            If making on a stove-top, place a heat diffuser (or any flat pan) on low to medium flame and keep the biryani pot over the diffuser. This will ensure even heat distribution and prevent burning of food and dum cook for 1 hour. For the oven, keep it up to 1 hour and 10 mins. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Open and remove the foil - let it cool for 5 minutes before you stir the rice (You may dig and check if the meat is done. If you see that it needs cooking, then put it back in the oven. The residue heat of the oven will be enough to get it done). Serve kacchi mutton biryani hot with cold salads, kachumber raita and papadams.
        </li>
