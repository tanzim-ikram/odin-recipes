    <p>
        Tehari is an authentic Bangladeshi dish of aromatic rice and meat pilaf packing a fiery and flavorful punch. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It's a dish of Awadhi origin from India called Tehri, which traditionally consisted of yellow rice and potatoes, like a vegetable biryani. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawab rulers in South Asia. Tehri became more popular during the Second World War when meat prices increased substantially and potato became the popular substitute in biryani. The Bangladeshi version Tehari is unique in the sense that unlike it's original prototype, ours is non-vegetarian and consists of short grain aromatic rice, combined with curried meat, cooked in mustard oil and lots and lots of fresh green chilies.

        In the book, Dhaka Pachas Baras Pehle, Hakim Habibur Rahman refers to this dish as Tahiri, eaten during breakfast and brunch. Nowadays, it is a sought after street food in Puran dhaka, the historic old part of the city known for it's mughal influence. Puran Dhaka used to be called Jahangir Nagar named after the Emperor Jahangir and it was established as the capital of Mughal Bengal in 1608. The old city is now a heritage site and a food landmark renowned for biryani, morog polau, kababs and many more delectable dishes, including tehari. The most famous Bangladeshi tehari can be found in one of the oldest restaurants in the heart of Puran Dhaka known as Haji Biryani, where they have been serving the exact original tehari recipe since 1939.

        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tsp kewra water</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>5 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp mace powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the meat into small pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grind cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaves, cloves, peppercorn and make them into powder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add all the powdered spices, salt, ginger, garlic, yogurt, mustard oil with the meat and mix very well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Marinate for at least 30-60 minutes. For best results, marinate for 5-6 hours before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the meat is marinating, rinse and soak the rice (especially if it is Basmati rice) for at least 30-60 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the onions turn light brown, add chilis. Depending on how spicy you want, you can make slits on the chilis or use them whole. Add the marinated meat and mix well for 5 minutes. Cover and cook in low medium heat for about 10-15 minutes. The meat should release water and should cook in the same water. Keep an eye on the meat so that the water from meat does not evaporate in those 10-15 minutes and the meat does not burn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Warm oil in a pot and add onions. Add 1 cup of warm water, stir and cover. Cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes until the meat is tender and the water has evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove only the meat, leaving the oil and spices in the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add rice to the oil and fry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 4 cups of warm water and salt. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes. When the rice starts bubbling, add the cooked meat and gently stir. Keep flame in low heat and cook for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uncover, add Kewra water and stir very gently so that the rice do not break. Cover and cook in low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the flame, stir the Tehari gently and leave it covered for 5-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve warm with salad.
        </li>
    </ol>
